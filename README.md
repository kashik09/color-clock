## 🎯 How It Works

The clock uses React's rendering with `date-fns` to format the current date and time. The display updates whenever the component renders, showing:
- Full day name
- Complete date
- Time with seconds and AM/PM

## 💻 Development
```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```
